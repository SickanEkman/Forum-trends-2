--- TF*IDF algorithm ---
Tried option to count TF as (word count / number tokens in document) instead of (word count / max occurences).
Removed said option because result (internal order of words in final list) was identical, but with smaller numbers.

"Korv" problem: Would be nice to change prepare_extraction file so it excludes words that only appears in one thread.
But I don't have time - it's just to complicated to do right now.
